# Data Science Portfolio

## Description

This project consists of 4 major sections:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression
- Classification
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Remarks:  
For the CNN and RNN notebook are hosted on Kaggle because of the large dataset is required for the notebooks.
